## ⚡ The Problem
LLMs (Cursor, Windsurf, Copilot, ChatGPT) are trained on the *average* of the internet. By default, they suggest median code—often outdated, insecure, or utilizing legacy patterns.

## 🛡️ The Solution
**`sota-codex`** is a repository of **binding instructions, architectural blueprints, and strict rule sets** designed to force AI agents out of the "average" and into the **State-of-the-Art (SOTA)**.

It serves as the "Source of Truth" to align AI output with modern 2026+ engineering standards.
